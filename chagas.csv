Imidazolines can be considered as ethylenediamine/carbonyl precursors and therefore interfere with the biosynthesis of polyamines into the parasite. Some of the derivatives were found to have high and selective activity against the proliferative stages of the parasite, with IC(50) values against the epimastigote form in the low micromolar range as the reference drug Nifurtimox. The imidazolidines demonstrated to be stable after five days of incubation in buffer glucose, pH 7, indicating that diamines were not obtained in these conditions. But it was found that two of the studied diamine precursors were as active as the parent compounds. Probably, the imidazolidines affect the mitochondrial integrity according to the excreted end-products found in the NMR studies. The QSAR studies indicated that the bioactivities are correlated with the lipophilicities. In conclusion, we have described a new and relevant bioactivity for imidazolidines.

For this purpose, T. cruzi stocks representative of the genetic T. cruzi lineages, displaying different susceptibilities to BZ, belonging to the major T. cruzi genotypes broadly dispersed in North and South America and important in Chagas' disease epidemiology were used. Therapeutic efficacy was observed in 27.8% of the animals treated. Following BZ susceptibility classification, significant differences were observed in dual infections on the major genotype level, demonstrating that combinations of genotypes 19+39 and genotypes 19+32 led to a shift in the expected BZ susceptibility profile toward the resistance pattern. Analysis on the T. cruzi stock level demonstrated that 9 out of 24 dual infections shifted the expected BZ susceptibility profile compared with the respective single infections, including shifts toward lower and higher BZ susceptibilities. Microsatellite identification was able to identify a mixture of T. cruzi stocks in 7.7% of the T. cruzi isolates from infected and untreated mice (6.9%) and infected and treated but not cured mice (9.0%), revealing in some mixtures of BZ-susceptible and -resistant stocks that the T. cruzi stock identified after BZ treatment was previously susceptible in single infections. Considering the clonal structure and evolution of T. cruzi, an unexpected result was the identification of parasite subpopulations with distinct microsatellite alleles in relation to the original stocks observed in 12.2% of the isolates. Taken together, the data suggest that mixed infections, already verified in nature, may have an important impact on the efficacy of chemotherapy.";"1";"1";"22";"CHEMBL_2";"2009-11-30"

In a previous study we identified a novel family of bisphosphonates, metabolically stable analogs of PP(i), which are potent and selective inhibitors of TcHK as well as the proliferation of the clinically relevant intracellular amastigote form of the parasite in vitro (Hudock, M. P., Sanz-Rodriguez, C. E., Song, Y., Chan, J. M., Zhang, Y., Odeh, S., Kosztowski, T., Leon-Rossell, A., Concepcion, J. L., Yardley, V., Croft, S. L., Urbina, J. A., and Oldfield, E. (2006) J. Med.

In this work, we report a detailed kinetic analysis of the effects of three of these bisphosphonates on homogeneous TcHK, as well as on the enzyme in purified intact glycosomes, peroxisome-like organelles that contain most of the glycolytic pathway enzymes in this organism. We also investigated the effects of the same compounds on glucose consumption by intact and digitonin-permeabilized T. cruzi epimastigotes, and on the growth of such cells in liver-infusion tryptose medium. The bisphosphonates investigated were several orders of magnitude more active than PP(i) as non-competitive or mixed inhibitors of TcHK and blocked the use of glucose by the epimastigotes, inducing a metabolic shift toward the use of amino acids as carbon and energy sources. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between the IC(50) values for TcHK inhibition and those for epimastigote growth inhibition for the 12 most potent compounds of this series. Finally, these bisphosphonates did not affect the sterol composition of the treated cells, indicating that they do not act as inhibitors of farnesyl diphosphate synthase. Taken together, our results suggest that these novel bisphosphonates act primarily as specific inhibitors of TcHK and may represent a novel class of selective anti-T. cruzi agents.";"12";"2";"74";"CHEMBL_1";"2009-09-03"

To investigate the mode of action, the P. falciparum KASIII enzyme was produced for inhibitor assay. A number of TLM derivatives were identified that showed improved inhibition of this enzyme compared to TLM. Structure-activity relationships for enzyme inhibition were identified for some series of TLM analogues, and these also showed weak correlation with inhibition of parasite growth, but this did not hold for other series. On the basis of the lack of a clear correlation between inhibition of pfKASIII activity and parasite growth, we conclude that pfKASIII is not the primary target of TLM analogues.

Ribavirin binds to the adenosine-binding site of the two SAHHs and reduces the NAD(+) cofactor to NADH.

The goal was to improve the affinity, selectivity, and solubility of previously reported 2'-deoxy-2'-(3-methoxybenzamido)adenosine (1). It was found that introduction of hydroxyl functions on the benzamido ring increases solubility without significantly affecting enzyme inhibition. Modifications at the previously unexploited N6-position of the purine not only lead to a substantial increase in inhibitor potency but are also compatible with the 2'-benzamido moiety of the sugar. For N6-substituted adenosines, two successive rounds of modeling and screening provided a 330-fold gain in affinity versus that of adenosine. The combination of N6- and 2'-substitutions produced significantly improved inhibitors.

These thiocyanate analogues were envisioned bearing in mind the potent activity shown by 4-phenoxyphenoxyethyl thiocyanate (compound 8) taken as lead drug. This compound had previously proved to be an extremely active growth inhibitor against T. cruzi with IC(50) values ranging from the very low micromolar level in epimastigotes to the low nanomolar level in the intracellular form of the parasite. Of the designed compounds, the ethyl thiocyanate drugs connected to nonpolar skeletons, namely, arylthio, 2,4-dichlorophenoxy, ortho-substituted aryloxy, and 2-methyl-4-phenoxyphenoxy (compounds 15, 34, 47, 52, 72, respectively), were shown to be very potent antireplicative agents against T. cruzi. On the other hand, conformationally restricted analogues as well as branched derivatives at the aliphatic side chain were shown to be moderately active against T. cruzi growth. The biological activity of drugs bearing the thiocyanate group correlated quite well with the activity exhibited by their normal precursors, the tetrahydropyranyl ether derivatives, when bonded to the same nonpolar skeleton. Compounds having the tetrahydropyranyl moeity as polar end were proportionally much less active than sulfur-containing derivatives in all cases. Drugs 47 and 72 also resulted to be very active against the amastigote form of the parasite growing in myoblasts; however, they were slightly less active than the lead drug 8.

Our data show that the reversed amidines have higher levels of activity than the diguanidine, with the order of trypanocidal activities being as follows: DB889 > DB702 > DB786 > DB711. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that the reversed amidines induced many alterations in the nuclear morphology, swelling of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi structures, and consistent damage in the mitochondria and kinetoplasts of the parasites. Interestingly, in trypomastigotes treated with the reversed amidine DB889, multiple axoneme structures (flagellar microtubules) were noted. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that the treated parasites presented an important loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, as revealed by a decrease in rhodamine 123 fluorescence. Our results show that the reversed amidines have promising activities against the relevant mammalian forms of T. cruzi and display high trypanocidal effects at very low doses.

Starting from menadione, plumbagin, and juglone, three distinct series of 1,4-naphthoquinones (NQ) were synthesized as potential inhibitors of TR from Trypanosoma cruzi (TcTR). The three parent molecules were functionalized at carbons 2 and/or 3 by various polyamine chains. Optimization of TcTR inhibition and TcTR specificity versus human disulfide reductases was achieved with the 3,3'-[polyaminobis(carbonylalkyl)]bis(1,4-NQ) series 19-20, in which an optimum chain length was determined for inhibition of the trypanothione disulfide reduction. The most active derivatives against trypanosomes in cultures were also studied as subversive substrates of TcTR and lipoamide dehydrogenase (TcLipDH). The activities were measured by following NAD(P)H oxidation as well as coupling the reactions to the reduction of cytochrome c which permits the detection of one-electron transfer. For TcTR, 20(4-c) proved to be a potent subversive substrate and an effective uncompetitive inhibitor versus trypanothione disulfide and NADPH. Molecular modeling studies based on the known X-ray structures of TcTR and hGR were conducted in order to compare the structural features, dimensions, and accessibility of the cavity at the dimer interface of TcTR with that of hGR, as one of the putative NQ binding sites. TcLipDH reduced the plumbagin derivatives by an order of magnitude faster than the corresponding menadione derivatives. Such differences were not observed with the pig heart enzyme. The most efficient and specific subversive substrates of TcTR and TcLipDH exhibited potent antitrypanosomal activity in in vitro T. brucei and T. cruzi cultures.

Currently there is an urgent need to develop antitrypanosomal therapy due to the toxicity of existing agents and emerging drug resistance. A novel series of potent thio semicarbazone small-molecule inhibitors of the Trypanosoma cruzi cysteine protease cruzain have been identified. Some of these inhibitors have been shown to be trypanocidal. We initially discovered that 3'-bromopropiophenone thio semicarbazone (1i) inhibited cruzain and could cure mammalian cell cultures infected with T. cruzi. 3'-Bromopropiophenone thio semicarbazone showed no toxicity for mammalian cells at concentrations that were trypanocidal. Following this lead, more than 100 compounds were designed and synthesized. A specific structure-activity relationship (SAR) was established, and many potent analogues with IC(50) values in the low nanomolar range were identified. Eight additional analogues were trypanocidal in a cell culture assay, and this indicates that aryl thio semicarbazone is a productive scaffold for killing the parasites. Kinetic studies show that these are time-dependent inhibitors. Molecular modeling studies of the enzyme-inhibitor complex have led to a proposed mechanism of interaction as well as insight into the SAR of the thio semicarbazone series.

Despite the continuous efforts of many organizations and institutions, CD is still an important human health problem worldwide. A lack of a safe and affordable treatment has led drug discovery programmes to focus, for years, on the search for molecules enabling interference with enzymes that are essential for T. cruzi survival. In this work, the authors want to offer a brief overview of the different validated targets that are involved in diverse parasite pathways: glycolysis, sterol synthesis, the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides, the degradative processing of peptides and proteins, oxidative stress damage and purine salvage and nucleotide synthesis and metabolism. Their structural aspects, function, active sites, etc. were studied and considered with the aim of defining molecular bases in the search for new effective treatments for CD. This review also compiles, as much as possible, all the inhibitors reported to date against these T. cruzi targets, serving as a reference for future research in this field.";"30";"6";"31";"CHEMBL_33";"2023-05-31"

Here we investigated features of the disposition of K02 using in vitro systems, characterizing the interaction of the drug with human cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a mediator of multidrug resistance (MDR) to cancer chemotherapy and a countertransporter in the intestine that limits oral drug bioavailability. P-gp functions as an ATP-dependent drug efflux pump to reduce intracellular cytotoxic concentrations. An HPLC assay was developed to analyze K02 and its metabolites formed in human liver microsomes. Three major primary metabolites were determined by LC/MS/MS to be hydroxylated products of the parent compound. A rabbit anti-CYP3A polyclonal antibody (200 microl antibody/mg microsomal protein) produced 75-94% inhibition of the formation of these three hydroxylated metabolites. Ketoconazole (5 microM), a selective CYP3A inhibitor, produced up to 75% inhibition, whereas other CYP-specific inhibitors, i.e. quinidine (CYP2D6), 7,8-benzoflavone (CYP1A2), and sulfaphenazole (CYP2C9), showed no significant effects. An identical metabolite formation profile for K02 was observed with cDNA-expressed human CYP3A4 (Gentest). These data demonstrate that K02 is a substrate for CYP3A. Formation of 1'-hydroxymidazolam, the primary human midazolam metabolite, was markedly inhibited by K02 via competitive processes, which suggests the potential for drug-drug interactions of K02 with other CYP3A substrates. K02 significantly inhibited the photoaffinity labeling of P-gp with azidopine and LU-49888, a photoaffinity analogue of verapamil. Transport studies with [14C]K02, using MDR1-transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cell monolayers in the Transwell system, demonstrated that the basolateral-to-apical flux of K02 across MDR1-transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells was markedly greater than the apical-to-basolateral flux (ratio of 63 with 10 microM [14C]K02). This suggests that K02 is also a P-gp substrate. These studies are important for formulating strategies to increase the absorption and/or decrease the elimination of K02 and to optimize its delivery to malignant cells and parasite-infected host cells.";"3";"1";"5";"CHEMBL_15";"2013-01-23"

Herein, multivariate approaches (hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis) were applied to a set of thirty-six formerly characterized compounds. Based on the findings from exploratory data analysis, novel compounds were designed and synthesized. These compounds showed two-to three-fold higher trypanocidal activity against epimastigote forms than the previous set and were 25-30-fold more active than BZD. Their activity was also evaluated against intracellular amastigotes by high content screening (HCS).

A series of analogues of the known 1'-NHhexyl lead compound were prepared and evaluated against L. major in macrophage culture to further develop structure-activity relationships (SAR). Toxicity toward mammalian cells was measured in a human leukemia cell line, and the ratio of the two IC50 values (IC50(J)/IC50(L)) was used as a measure of the in vitro therapeutic index (IVTI). A 3,6-diNMe2 substitution pattern on the acridine greatly increased toxicity to L. major without altering mammalian toxicity, increasing IVTIs over that of the lead compound. The 2-OMe, 6-Cl acridine substitution pattern used in the antimalarial drug mepacrine also resulted in potent antileishmanial activity and high IVTIs. Earlier suggestions of the utility of 2'-OR groups in lowering mammalian cytotoxicity were not borne out in this wider study. A series of very lipophilic 1'-NRR (symmetric dialkylamino)-substituted analogues showed relatively high antileishmanial potency, but no clear trend was apparent across the series, and none were superior to the 1'-NH(CH2)5Me subclass. Subsets of the most active 1'-N(R)(CH2)5Me- and 1'-N(alkyl)2-substituted compounds against L. major were also evaluated against Leishmania donovani, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Trypanosoma brucei, but no consistent SAR could be discerned in these physiologically diverse test systems.

This thiocyanate derivative was previously shown to be an effective and potent agent against T. cruzi proliferation. Several drugs possessing thiocyanate groups proved to be effective growth inhibitors of T. cruzi growth.

All of them exhibited IC(50) values in the low micromolar range, and these values were comparable with those presented by our lead drug 4 and ketokonazole, a well-known antiparasitic agent. The activity displayed by the nitrogen-containing derivative 90 was very promising with IC(50) values of 3.3 microM. Several other thiocyanate derivatives also proved to be very potent inhibitors of the multiplication of T. cruzi epimastigotes, such as compounds 28, 33, 43, 48, 56, 61, 66, 71, 76, and 124. Compound 43 resulted in being a promising drug because it was also very effective against amastigotes, the clinically more relevant form of the parasite. This compound was 3-fold more potent than 4, while 11 showed nearly the same activity as our lead drug against intracellular T. cruzi. It was very surprising that the experimental juvenoid 124, although fairly devoid of activity against epimastigotes, was very effective against intracellular amastigotes growing in myoblasts. The rest of the designed compounds showed a broad degree of inhibitory action, from moderately active drugs to drugs almost devoid of antiparasitic activity.

Electronic properties are calculated by means of semiempirical (PM3), ab initio (HF/3-21G) and density functional theory (B3LYP/6-31+G*) methodologies. Three different electronic states, neutral quinones, hydroquinones and semiquinones, are studied to investigate if any one of them are statistically related with the biological activities. The best correlations were obtained at the B3LYP level of theory because it includes electronic correlation. The QSAR-2D indicates that the best trypanocidal growth inhibitors are molecules in the semiquinone electronic state, with the following properties: (a) high negative value of EHOMO, (b) high negative charge in the oxygen atoms of the carbonyl groups, (c) high positive charge in the carbon atom of one of carbonyl moieties and (d) high electronegativity (chi). In a complementary way, the QSAR-3D indicates that the electrostatic field correlates with trypanocidal activity and the presence of bulk moieties would increase activity. The idea of comparing the three electronic states may prove to be of most importance in the general strategy to the design of new trypanocidal drugs. In fact, the experimental results showed that semiquinone is the one really statistically relevant indicating a clear connection between biochemical and theoretical aspects. Finally, we demonstrated that to be a good anti-trypanosomatid compound, the molecule must be a good electron acceptor to reach easily the essential semiquinone state. We expect that the present results motivate new experimental as well as theoretical investigations that confirm our findings.";"9";"3";"34";"CHEMBL_2";"2009-11-30"

Classic clinical manifestations result from the infection of heart muscle cells leading to progressive cardiomyopathy. To ameliorate disease, chemotherapy must eradicate the parasite. Current drugs are ineffective and toxic, and new therapy is a critical need. To expedite drug screening for this neglected disease, we have developed and validated a cell-based, high-throughput assay that can be used with a variety of untransfected T. cruzi isolates and host cells and that simultaneously measures efficacy against the intracellular amastigote stage and toxicity to host cells. T. cruzi-infected muscle cells were incubated in 96-well plates with test compounds. Assay plates were automatically imaged and analyzed based on size differences between the DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)-stained host cell nuclei and parasite kinetoplasts. A reduction in the ratio of T. cruzi per host cell provided a quantitative measure of parasite growth inhibition, while a decrease in count of the host nuclei indicated compound toxicity. The assay was used to screen a library of clinically approved drugs and identified 55 compounds with activity against T. cruzi. The flexible assay design allows the use of various parasite strains, including clinical isolates with different biological characteristics (e.g., tissue tropism and drug sensitivity), and a broad range of host cells and may even be adapted to screen for inhibitors against other intracellular pathogens. This high-throughput assay will have an important impact in antiparasitic drug discovery.";"57";"3";"174";"CHEMBL_11";"2011-08-01"

Recent findings have underscored the abundance of the causative organism, (T. cruzi), especially in the southern tier states of the US and the risk burden for the rural farming communities there. Due to a lack of safe and effective drugs, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic options for treating Chagas disease. We report here our first scientific effort to pursue a novel drug design for treating Chagas disease via the targeting of T. cruzi tubulin. First, the anti T. cruzi tubulin activities of five naphthoquinone derivatives were determined and correlated to their anti-trypanosomal activities. The correlation between the ligand activities against the T. cruzi organism and their tubulin inhibitory activities was very strong with a Pearson's r value of 0.88 (P value <0.05), indicating that this class of compounds could inhibit the activity of the trypanosome organism via T. cruzi tubulin polymerization inhibition. Subsequent molecular modeling studies were carried out to understand the mechanisms of the anti-tubulin activities, wherein, the homology model of T. cruzi tubulin dimer was generated and the putative binding site of naphthoquinone derivatives was predicted. The correlation coefficient for ligand anti-tubulin activities and their binding energies at the putative pocket was found to be r=0.79, a high correlation efficiency that was not replicated in contiguous candidate pockets. The homology model of T. cruzi tubulin and the identification of its putative binding site lay a solid ground for further structure based drug design, including molecular docking and pharmacophore analysis. This study presents a new opportunity for designing potent and selective drugs for Chagas disease.";"6";"2";"11";"CHEMBL_23";"2017-05-01"

Most of these drugs exhibited an extremely potent inhibitory action against the intracellular form of T. cruzi, exhibiting IC(50) values at the low micromolar level. This cellular activity was associated with a strong inhibition of the enzymatic activity of T. cruzi farnesyl diphosphate synthase (TcFPPS), which constitutes a valid target for Chagas' disease chemotherapy. Compound 17 was an effective agent against amastigotes exhibiting an IC(50) value of 0.84 microM, while this compound showed an IC(50) value of 0.49 microM against the target enzyme TcFPPS. Interestingly, compound 19 was very effective against both T. cruzi and T. gondii exhibiting IC(50) values of 4.1 microM and 2.6 microM, respectively. In this case, 19 inhibited at least two different enzymes of T. cruzi (TcFPPS and solanesyl diphosphate synthase (TcSPPS); 1.01 microM and 0.25 microM, respectively), while it inhibited TgFPPS in T. gondii. In general, this family of drugs was less effective against the activity of T. cruzi SPPS and against T. gondii growth in vitro.

Therefore, new drugs to treat this disease are necessary. Thiazole compounds have been described as potent trypanocidal agents. Here we report the structural planning, synthesis and anti-T. cruzi evaluation of a new series of 1,3-thiazoles (7-28), which were designed by placing this heterocycle instead of thiazolidin-4-one ring. The synthesis was conducted in an ultrasonic bath with 2-propanol as solvent at room temperature. By varying substituents attached to the phenyl and thiazole rings, substituents were observed to retain, enhance or greatly increase their anti-T. cruzi activity. In some cases, methyl at position 5 of the thiazole (compounds 9, 12 and 23) increased trypanocidal property. The exchange of phenyl for pyridinyl heterocycle resulted in increased activity, giving rise to the most potent compound against the trypomasigote form (14, IC50trypo = 0.37 μM). Importantly, these new thiazoles were toxic for trypomastigotes without affecting macrophages and cardiomyoblast viability. The compounds were also evaluated against cruzain, and five of the most active compounds against trypomastigotes (7, 9, 12, 16 and 23) inhibited more than 70% of enzymatic activity at 10 μM, among which compound 7 had an IC50 in the submicromolar range, suggesting a possible mechanism of action. In addition, examination of T. cruzi cell death showed that compound 14 induces apoptosis. We also examined the activity against intracellular parasites, revealing that compound 14 inhibited T. cruzi infection with potency similar to benznidazole. The antiparasitic effect of 14 and benznidazole in combination was also investigated against trypomastigotes and revealed that they have synergistic effects, showing a promising profile for drug combination. Finally, in mice acutely-infected with T. cruzi,14 treatment significanty reduced the blood parasitaemia and had a protective effect on mortality. In conclusion, we report the identification of compounds (7), (12), (15), (23) and (26) with similar trypanocidal activity of benznidazole; compounds (9) and (21) as trypanocidal agents equipotent with BDZ, and compound 14 with potency 28 times better than the reference drug without affecting macrophages and cardiomyoblast viability. Mechanistically, the compounds inhibit cruzain, and 14 induces T. cruzi cell death by an apoptotic process, being considered a good starting point for the development of new anti-Chagas drug candidates.";"25";"6";"161";"CHEMBL_26";"2020-01-10"

The in vitro activities of these novel compounds were superior to that of nifurtimox, a nitrofuran currently used in the treatment of human Chagas' disease, and terbinafine, a commercially available allylamine-based squalene epoxidase inhibitor.

Starting from easily accessible educts, this approach allowed the synthesis of hitherto unknown compounds with a varied substitution pattern. As a result of steric hindrance, preferential formation of the 3-substituted isomers over the 1-substituted isomers was observed when cyclizing N-(3-substituted-phenyl)-N'-[2-(2-trimethylsilylethynyl)phenyl]carbodiimides. All compounds were evaluated for their activity against chloroquine-sensitive as well as chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains, for their activity against Trypanosoma brucei and T. cruzi, and for their cytotoxicity on human MRC-5 cells. Mechanisms of action were investigated by testing heme complexation using ESI-MS, inhibition of beta-hematin formation, DNA interactions (DNA-methyl green assay and linear dichroism), and inhibition of human topoisomerase II. Neocryptolepine derivatives with a higher antiplasmodial activity and a lower cytotoxicity than the original lead have been obtained. This selective antiplasmodial activity was associated with inhibition of beta-hematin formation. 2-Bromoneocryptolepine was the most selective compound with an IC(50) value against chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum of 4.0 microM in the absence of cytotoxicity (IC(50) > 32 microM). Although cryptolepine, a known lead for antimalarials also originally isolated from Cryptolepis sanguinolenta, was more active (IC(50) = 2.0 microM), 2-bromoneocryptolepine showed a low affinity for DNA and no inhibition of human topoisomerase II, in contrast to cryptolepine. Although some neocryptolepine derivatives showed a higher antiplasmodial activity than 2-bromocryptolepine, these compounds also showed a higher affinity for DNA and/or a more pronounced cytotoxicity. Therefore, 2-bromoneocryptolepine is considered as the most promising lead from the present work for new antimalarial agents. In addition, 2-bromo-, 2-nitro-, and 2-methoxy-9-cyanoneocryptolepine exhibited antitrypanosomal activity in the micromolar range in the absence of obvious cytotoxicity.";"27";"6";"186";"CHEMBL_1";"2009-09-03"

Ravuconazole was well tolerated, as no significant side effects were observed during the treatment using 6.0 mg/kg twice a day (12 mg/kg/day) for up to 90 days. In all treated animals, parasitemia was permanently suppressed by the first day of treatment, independently of the parasite strain. Cultures of blood obtained posttreatment were negative for 90% of the animals, confirming that the drug induced a marked reduction in the parasite load. The results of PCR tests for T. cruzi in blood performed 1 month posttreatment were consistently negative for three of five and two of five animals infected with the Y and Berenice-78 strains, respectively. All ravuconazole-treated dogs consistently had negative serological test results during and until 30 days after treatment, regardless of the therapeutic scheme used. However, after the end of treatment, an increase in specific antibody levels was observed in all treated animals, although the antibody levels were always significantly lower than those of the nontreated control dogs. Despite being unable to induce a parasitological cure, ravuconazole treatment led to significant reductions in the levels of gamma interferon expression and lesions in cardiac tissues in animals infected with the Y strain, while the level of interleukin-10 mRNA expression increased. We conclude that ravuconazole has potent suppressive but not curative activity in the canine model of acute Chagas' disease, probably due to its unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties (half-life, 8.8 h). The longer half-life of ravuconazole in humans (4 to 8 days) makes it a promising drug for assessment for use as chemotherapy in human Chagas' disease.";"2";"4";"73";"CHEMBL_11";"2011-08-01"

Peptidomimetic vinyl heterocyclic inhibitors (PVHIs) containing Cbz-Phe-Phe/homoPhe scaffolds with vinyl-2-pyrimidine, vinyl-2-pyridine, and vinyl-2-(N-methyl)-pyridine groups conferred reversible, time-dependent inhibition of cruzain (Ki* = 0.1-0.4 μM).

In a mouse model of HAT, 3 extended life of treated mice by 50%, compared to untreated controls. At the cellular level, 3 inhibited mitosis and cytokinesis in T. brucei.

The following bacterial, fungal and protozoan organisms were included in the study: Vibrio cholerae, Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania donovani chagasi, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida glabrata, and Plasmodium falciparum. The eight pathozymes present in these organisms were efficiently inhibited by the four generations PAMAM-sulfonamide dendrimers, but multivalency effects were highly variable among the different enzyme classes. The Vibrio enzyme VchCA was best inhibited by the G3 dendrimer incorporating 32 sulfamoyl moieties. The Trypanosoma enzyme TcCA on the other hand was best inhibited by the first generation dendrimer G0 (with 4 sulfamoyl groups), whereas for other enzymes the optimal inhibitory power was observed for the G1 or G2 dendrimers, with 8 and 16 sulfonamide functionalities. This study thus proves that the multivalency may be highly relevant for enzyme inhibition for some but not all CAs from pathogenic organisms. On the other hand, some dendrimers investigated here showed a better inhibitory power compared to acetazolamide for enzymes from widespread pathogens, such as the η-CA from Plasmodium falciparum.

These results compare favorably with those reported for posaconazole. Electron microscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of sterol composition confirmed that treatment with LP10 blocked the 14alpha-demethylation step and induced breakdown of parasite cell membranes, culminating in severe ultrastructural and morphological alterations and death of the clinically relevant amastigote stage of the parasite.";"3";"2";"35";"CHEMBL_10";"2011-05-26"

R5P is the precursor for the biosynthesis of nucleotides while NADPH is the cofactor of several dehydrogenases acting in a broad range of biosynthetic processes and in the maintenance of the cellular redox state. RNA interference-mediated reduction of G6PDH levels in bloodstream-form Trypanosoma brucei validated this enzyme as a drug target against Human African Trypanosomiasis. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a human steroidal pro-hormone and its derivative 16α-bromoepiandrosterone (16BrEA) are uncompetitive inhibitors of mammalian G6PDH. Such steroids are also known to enhance the immune response in a broad range of animal infection models. It is noteworthy that the administration of DHEA to rats infected by Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Human American Trypanosomiasis (also known as Chagas' disease), reduces blood parasite levels at both acute and chronic infection stages. In the present work, we investigated the in vitro effect of DHEA derivatives on the proliferation of T. cruzi epimastigotes and their inhibitory effect on a recombinant form of the parasite's G6PDH (TcG6PDH). Our results show that DHEA and its derivative epiandrosterone (EA) are uncompetitive inhibitors of TcG6PDH, with K(i) values of 21.5 ± 0.5 and 4.8 ± 0.3 μM, respectively. Results from quantitative inhibition assays indicate 16BrEA as a potent inhibitor of TcG6PDH with an IC₅₀ of 86 ± 8 nM and those from in vitro cell viability assays confirm its toxicity for T. cruzi epimastigotes, with a LD₅₀ of 12 ± 8 μM.

In the present study, the rational drug design approach was used to discover tricyclic neuroleptic molecular frameworks as lead structures for the development of inhibitors, selective for trypanothione reductase over host glutathione reductase. From a homology-modeled structure for trypanothione reductase, replaced in the later stages of the study by the X-ray coordinates for the enzyme from Crithidia fasciculata, a series of inhibitors based on phenothiazine was designed. These were shown to be reversible inhibitors of trypanothione reductase from Trypanosoma cruzi, linearly competitive with trypanothione as substrate and noncompetitive with NADPH, consistent with ping-pong bi bi kinetics. Analogues, synthesized to define structure-activity relationships for the active site, included N-acylpromazines, 2-substituted phenothiazines, and trisubstituted promazines. Analysis of Ki and I50 data, on the basis of calculated log P and molar refractivity values, provided evidence of a specially favored fit of small 2-substituents (especially 2-chloro and 2-trifluoromethyl), with a remote hydrophobic patch on the enzyme accessible for larger, hydrophobic 2-substituents. There was also evidence of an additional hydrophobic enzymic region available to suitable N-substituents of the promazine nucleus. Ki data also indicated that the phenothiazine nucleus can adopt more than one inhibitory orientation in its binding site.

The 4-furoxanyl nitrone 3 (FxBN), alpha(Z)-(3-methylfuroxan-4-yl)-N-tert-butylnitrone, showed appropriate solubility in aqueous solution and taking into account that this physicochemical property is very important for biological applications, we studied it deeply in terms of its trapping and kinetic behaviors. For this, kinetic studies of the hydroxyl adduct decay gave rate constants k(ST) of 1.22x10(10)dm(3)mol(-1)s(-1) and half-live up to 7200s at physiological pH, without any artifactual signals. The ability of FxBN to directly traps and stabilizes superoxide free radical, with a half-life of 1620s at physiological pH, was also demonstrated. Besides, FxBN-hydroxyl and -superoxide adducts exhibited distinct and characteristic EPR spectral patterns. Finally, we confirmed the ability of FxBN to act as spin trap in a specific biological system, that is, in the free radical production of experimental anti-trypanosomatid drugs using Trypanosoma cruzi microsomes as biological system. Moreover, previous observations of low FxBN toxicity transform it in a good candidate for in vivo spin trapping.";"3";"2";"11";"CHEMBL_5";"2010-06-24"

In addition, 2D and 3D structural similarity analyses revealed micromolar and submicromolar inhibitors of T. cruzi in ChEMBL with high similarity to the synthesized structures.";"4";"1";"6";"CHEMBL_16";"2013-05-07"

Among them, acetylated ester products, in which the lipase catalyzed both reactions in one-pot, were obtained. The influence of various reaction parameters in the enzymatic reactions, such as enzyme source, acylating agent/substrate ratio, enzyme/substrate ratio, solvent and temperature, was studied. Some of the evaluated compounds showed a remarkable activity as Trypanosoma cruzi growth inhibitors, obtaining the best results with ethyl chenodeoxycholate 3-acetate and chenodeoxycholic acid 3,7-diacetate, which showed IC50: 8.6 and 22.8 μM, respectively. In addition, in order to shed light to bile acids behavior in enzymatic reactions, molecular modeling was applied to some derivatives.

The analogues were divided into three amino sugar scaffolds that included d-glucosamine (d-GlcN), d-mannosamine (d-ManN), and d-galactosamine (d-GalN); moreover, all but one of these compounds were novel. TcGlcK is an important metabolic enzyme that has a role in producing G6P for glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The inhibition of these pathways via glucose kinases (i.e., glucokinase and hexokinase) appears to be a strategic approach for drug discovery. Glucose kinases phosphorylate d-glucose with co-substrate ATP to yield G6P and the formed G6P enters both pathways for catabolism. The compound screen revealed five on-target confirmed inhibitors that were all from the d-GlcN series, such as compounds 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6. Four of these compounds were strong TcGlcK inhibitors (1, 2, 4, and 6) since they were found to have micromolar inhibitory constant (K<sub>i</sub>) values around 20 μM. Three of the on-target confirmed inhibitors (1, 5, and 6) revealed notable in vitro anti-T. cruzi activity with IC<sub>50</sub> values being less than 50 μM. Compound 1 was benzoyl glucosamine (BENZ-GlcN), a known TcGlcK inhibitor that was the starting point for the design of the compounds in this study; in addition, TcGlcK - compound 1 inhibition properties were previously determined [D'Antonio, E.

This was achieved by coupling the appropriate azido-sugars with a panel of 23 structurally diverse terminal alkynes by using the copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction, giving a library of 46 derivatives in good to excellent yield and with complete regioselectivity.

The activity of the compounds was evaluated against the enzymes cruzain and rhodesain as well as against Trypanosoma cruzi amastigote and trypomastigote forms. The 4-aminoquinoline derivatives showed promising activity against both enzymes, with IC50 values ranging from 15 to 125µM. These derivatives were selective inhibitors for the parasitic proteases, being unable to inhibit mammalian cathepsins B and S. The most active compound against cruzain (compound 5a; IC50=15µM) is considerably more synthetically accessible than 1, while retaining its ligand efficiency. As observed for the original lead, compound 5a was shown to be a competitive enzyme inhibitor. In addition, it was also active against T. cruzi (IC50=67.7µM). Interestingly, the pyrimidine derivative 4b, although inactive in enzymatic assays, was highly active against T. cruzi (IC50=3.1µM) with remarkable selectivity index (SI=128) compared to uninfected fibroblasts. Both 5a and 4b exhibit drug-like physicochemical properties and are predicted to have a favorable ADME profile, therefore having great potential as candidates for lead optimization in the search for new drugs to treat Chagas disease.";"37";"6";"161";"CHEMBL_25";"2018-12-10"

In this work, a group of abietic acid derivatives that are chemically stable and well characterised were introduced as candidates for the treatment of Chagas disease. In vitro and in vivo assays were performed in order to test the effectiveness of these compounds. Finally, those which showed the best activity underwent additional studies in order to elucidate the possible mechanism of action. In vitro results indicated that some compounds have low toxicity (i.e. >150 μM, against Vero cell) combined with high efficacy (i.e. <20 μM) against some forms of T. cruzi. Further in vivo studies on mice models confirmed the expectations of improvements in infected mice. In vivo tests on the acute phase gave parasitaemia inhibition values higher those of Bz, and a remarkable decrease in the reactivation of parasitaemia was found in the chronic phase after immunosuppression of the mice treated with one of the compounds. The morphological alterations found in treated parasites with our derivatives confirmed extensive damage; energetic metabolism disturbances were also registered by (1)H NMR. The demonstrated in vivo activity and low toxicity, together with the use of affordable starting products and the lack of synthetic complexity, put these abietic acid derivatives in a remarkable position toward the development of an anti-Chagasic agent.";"10";"10";"97";"CHEMBL_21";"2016-02-01"

Previously, the homologation of aryl thiosemicarbazones resulted in an increase in anti-T. cruzi activity in comparison to aryl thiosemicarbazones without a spacer group. Here, we report the structural planning, synthesis and anti-T. cruzi evaluation of new aryl thiosemicarbazones (9a-x), designed as more conformationally restricted compounds. By varying substituents attached to the phenyl ring, substituents were observed to retain, enhance or greatly increase the anti-T. cruzi activity, in comparison to the nonsubstituted derivative. In most cases, hydrophobic and bulky substituents, such as bromo, biphenyl and phenoxyl groups, greatly increased antiparasitic activity. Specifically, thiosemicarbazones were identified that inhibit the epimastigote proliferation and were toxic for trypomastigotes without affecting mouse splenocytes viability. The most potent anti-T. cruzi thiosemicarbazones were evaluated against cruzain. However, inhibition of this enzyme was not observed, suggesting that the compounds work through another mechanism. In addition, examination of T. cruzi cell death showed that these thiosemicarbazones induce apoptosis. In conclusion, the structural design executed within the series of aryl thiosemicarbazones (9a-x) led to the identification of new potent anti-T. cruzi agents, such as compounds (9h) and (9r), which greatly inhibited epimastigote proliferation, and demonstrated a toxicity for trypomastigotes, but not for splenocytes.

Recent international public-private initiatives address the potential of drug repositioning (i.e. finding second or further medical uses for known-medications) which can substantially improve the success at clinical trials and the innovation in the pharmaceutical field. In this work, we present the computer-aided identification of approved drugs clofazimine, benidipine and saquinavir as potential trypanocidal compounds and test their effects at biochemical as much as cellular level on different parasite stages.

The article illustrates the potential of computer-guided drug repositioning to integrate and optimize drug discovery and preclinical development; it also proposes rational rules to select which among repositioned candidates should advance to investigational drug status and offers a new insight on clofazimine and benidipine as candidate treatments for Chagas disease.

The disease affects 6-8 million people, mostly in Latin America countries, and kills more people in the region each year than any other parasite-born disease, including malaria. Moreover, patient numbers are currently increasing in non-endemic, developed countries, such as Australia, Japan, Canada, and the United States. The treatment is limited to one drug, benznidazole, which is only effective in the acute phase of the disease and is very toxic. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new, safer, and effective drugs against the chronic phase of Chagas disease. Using a QSAR-based virtual screening followed by in vitro experimental evaluation, we report herein the identification of novel potent and selective hits against T. cruzi intracellular stage. We developed and validated binary QSAR models for prediction of anti-trypanosomal activity and cytotoxicity against mammalian cells using the best practices for QSAR modeling. These models were then used for virtual screening of a commercial database, leading to the identification of 39 virtual hits. Further in vitro assays showed that seven compounds were potent against intracellular T. cruzi at submicromolar concentrations (EC50 < 1 μM) and were very selective (SI > 30). Furthermore, other six compounds were also inside the hit criteria for Chagas disease, which presented activity at low micromolar concentrations (EC50 < 10 μM) against intracellular T. cruzi and were also selective (SI > 15). Moreover, we performed a multi-parameter analysis for the comparison of tested compounds regarding their balance between potency, selectivity, and predicted ADMET properties. In the next studies, the most promising compounds will be submitted to additional in vitro and in vivo assays in acute model of Chagas disease, and can be further optimized for the development of new promising drug candidates against this important yet neglected disease.";"40";"3";"143";"CHEMBL_28";"2021-01-15"

Many of these sulfur-containing bisphosphonates were potent inhibitors against the intracellular form of T. cruzi, the clinically more relevant replicative form of this parasite, and tachyzoites of T. gondii targeting T. cruzi or T. gondii farnesyl diphosphate synthases (FPPSs), which constitute valid targets for the chemotherapy of these parasitic diseases. Interestingly, long chain length sulfur-containing bisphosphonates emerged as relevant antiparasitic agents. Taking compounds 37, 38, and 39 as representative members of this class of drugs, they exhibited ED(50) values of 15.8 μM, 12.8 μM, and 22.4 μM, respectively, against amastigotes of T. cruzi. These cellular activities matched the inhibition of the enzymatic activity of the target enzyme (TcFPPS) having IC(50) values of 6.4 μM, 1.7 μM, and 0.097 μM, respectively. In addition, these compounds were potent anti-Toxoplasma agents. They had ED(50) values of 2.6 μM, 1.2 μM, and 1.8 μM, respectively, against T. gondii tachyzoites, while they exhibited a very potent inhibitory action against the target enzyme (TgFPPS) showing IC(50) values of 0.024 μM, 0.025 μM, and 0.021 μM, respectively. Bisphosphonates bearing a sulfoxide unit at C-3 were also potent anti-Toxoplasma agents, particularly those bearing long aliphatic chains such as 43-45, which were also potent antiproliferative drugs against tachyzoites of T. gondii.

A halogen-dance mechanism in quinoline series is also proposed. The formal synthesis of potential antimalarial compounds and the first total synthesis of 11-isopropylcryptolepine are also described. In the second part, cytotoxic activity against mammalian cells and activities against Plasmodium falciparum and Trypanosoma cruzi of benzo-delta-carbolines and delta-carbolines were evaluated in vitro to study the structure-activity relationships. For benzo-delta-carbolines, methylation at N-5 increases the cytotoxic and antiparasitic activities. A further alkylation on C-11 generally increases the cytotoxic activity but not the antiparasitic activity, cryptolepine and 11-methylcryptolepine being the most active on both parasites. Taking advantage of the fluorescence of the indoloquinoline chromophore, cryptolepine was localized by fluorescence microscopy in parasite DNA-containing structures suggesting that these compounds act through interaction with parasite DNA as proposed for cryptolepine on melanoma cells. For delta-carbolines, methylation at N-1 is essential for the antimalarial activity. 1-Methyl-delta-carboline specifically accumulates in the intracellular parasite. It has weak cytotoxic activity and can be considered as a potential antimalarial compound.";"40";"4";"238";"CHEMBL_1";"2009-09-03"

The rational design of ergosterol synthetic route inhibitors (e.g. CYP51 inhibitors) represents a promising strategy for fungi and trypanosomatids, exhibiting excellent anti-T.cruzi activity in pre-clinical assays. In the present work, we evaluate through different approaches (molecular docking, structure activity relationships, CYP51 inhibitory assay, and phenotypic screenings in vitro and in vivo) the potency and selectivity of a novel CYP51 inhibitor (compound 1) and its analogues against T.cruzi infection. Regarding anti-parasitic effect, compound 1 was active in vitro with EC50 3.86 and 4.00 μM upon intracellular (Tulahuen strain) and bloodstream forms (Y strain), respectively. In vivo assays showed that compound 1 reduced in 43% the parasitemia peak but, unfortunately failed to promote animal survival. In order to promote an enhancement at the potency and pharmacological properties, 17 new analogues were purchased and screened in vitro. Our findings demonstrated that five compounds were active against intracellular forms, highlighting compounds 1e and 1f, with EC50 2.20 and 2.70 μM, respectively, and selectivity indices (SI) = 50 and 36, respectively. Against bloodstream trypomastigotes, compound 1f reached an EC50 value of 20.62 μM, in a similar range to Benznidazole, but with low SI (3). Although improved the solubility of compound 1, the analogue 1f did not enhance the potency in vitro neither promote better in vivo efficacy against mouse model of acute T.cruzi infection arguing for the synthesis of novel pyrazolo[3,4-e][1,4]thiazepin derivatives aiming to contribute for alternative therapies for CD.";"22";"5";"183";"CHEMBL_26";"2020-01-10"

To address this issue, one strategy could be probing the susceptibility of <i>Trypanosoma</i> parasites toward NADP-dependent enzyme inhibitors. Recently, steroids of the androstane group have been described as highly potent but nonselective inhibitors of parasitic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). In order to promote selectivity, we have synthesized and evaluated 26 steroid derivatives of epiandrosterone in enzymatic assays, whereby 17 compounds were shown to display moderate to high selectivity for <i>T. cruzi</i> over the human G6PDH.

It was found that 2-methoxy and 2-histamino and N(6)-m-iodobenzyl substitutions generally produced analogs with low levels of antiprotozoal activity. The best antiplasmodial activity was achieved with large aromatic substitutions, such as N(6)-2,2-diphenylethyl and naphthylmethyl, which could indicate a mechanism of action through aromatic stacking with heme in the digestive vacuole of Plasmodium spp. The activities against Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes and Leishmania donovani amastigotes were generally low; but several analogs, particularly those with cyclopentylamino substitutions, displayed potent activities against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and T. b. brucei bloodstream forms in vitro. The most active were 2-cyclopentylamino-N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine (compound NA42) and 2-cyclopentylamino-N(6)-cyclopentyladenine (compound NA134), with the nucleobase an order of magnitude more potent than the nucleoside, at 26 +/- 4 nM. It was determined that the mode of action of these purines was trypanostatic, with the compounds becoming trypanocidal only at much higher concentrations. Those 2,N(6)-disubstituted purines tested for their effects on purine transport in T. b. brucei displayed at best a moderate affinity for the transporters. It is highly probable that the large hydrophobic substitutions, which bestow high calculated octanol-water coefficient values on the analogs, allow them to diffuse across the membrane. Consistent with this view, the analogs were as effective against a T. b. brucei strain lacking the P2 nucleoside transporter as they were against the parental strain. As the analogs were not toxic to human cell lines, the purine analogs are likely to act on a trypanosome-specific target.";"48";"10";"232";"CHEMBL_2";"2009-11-30"

Here, we identify new 5-nitrofuranes and the thia-analogues with excellent effects on the viability of T. cruzi and adequate parasite/mammal selectivity indexes. Analysis of the free sterols from parasite incubated, during 120h, with the compounds showed that some of them accumulated squalene suggesting the squalene epoxidase activity inhibition of the parasite. Nifurtimox was able to accumulate squalene only at lower incubation times. Due to this fact some derivatives were also tested as antifungal agents.

Here, we synthesized and evaluated the biological effect of pyrazole-imidazoline (1a-i) and pyrazole-tetrahydropyrimidine (2a-i) derivatives against relevant clinical forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. The structure-activity relationship (SAR), drug-target search, physicochemical and ADMET properties of the major active compounds in vitro were also assessed in silico. Pyrazole derivatives showed no toxicity in Vero cells and also no cardiotoxicity. Phenotypic screening revealed two dichlorinated pyrazole-imidazoline derivatives (1c and 1d) with trypanocidal activity higher than that of benznidazole (Bz) against trypomastigotes; these were also the most potent compounds against intracellular amastigotes. Replacement of imidazoline with tetrahydropyrimidine in the pyrazole compounds completely abolished the trypanocidal activity of series 2(a-i) derivatives. The physicochemical and ADMET properties of the compounds predicted good permeability, good oral bioavailability, no toxicity and mutagenicity of 1c and 1d. Pyrazole nucleus had high frequency hits for cruzipain in drug-target search and structure activity relationship (SAR) analysis of pyrazole-imidazoline derivatives revealed enhanced activity when chlorine atom was inserted in meta-positions of the benzene ring. Additionally, we found evidence that both compounds (1c and 1d) have the potential to interact non-covalently with the active site of cruzipain and also inhibit the cysteine proteinase activity of T. cruzi. Collectively, the data presented here reveal pyrazole derivatives with promise for further optimization in the therapy of Chagas disease.";"20";"4";"206";"CHEMBL_28";"2021-01-15"

HPLC, NMR, and mass spectrometry data of potential intermediates revealed a divinyl ketone as the active compound inactivating the enzyme. ESI- and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of trypanothione reductase modified by the Mannich base or the divinyl ketone showed specific alkylation of the active site Cys52 by a 5-(2'chlorophenyl)-3-oxo-4-pentenyl substituent. The reaction mechanism and the site of alkylation differ from those in Plasmodium falciparum thioredoxin reductase where the C-terminal redox active dithiol is modified.

In this context, there is an urgent need to develop new, safer and optimised anti-Tc agents. In this report, we present the synthesis and biological activity of 11 novel and 3 already reported N-arylsulfonyl-benzimidazole derivatives (NBSBZD,1-14) currently in development as potential anti-Tc compounds. These compounds were designed as part of a library of synthetic arylsulfonyl heterocycle derivatives constructed from privileged structures exhibiting drug-like properties. Based on bioactivity assays against Tc, (in both the extracellular and intracellular forms), we observed that 10 compounds exhibited bioactivity against the epimastigote form, while six of them exhibited activity against the amastigote counterpart. Also, the compounds showed less cytotoxicity compared to the reference drug BZN as measured in Vero cell culture. In order to elucidate the potential mechanism of action, metabolite excretion profiles studies were performed, and complemented with molecular modeling studies performed over known Tc druggable targets. Consistency was observed between experimental and theoretical findings, with metabolic profiles showing that compounds 1, 2, 9, 12 and 14 interfered with the normal glycolysis cycle of Tc, while molecular modeling studies were able to establish a solid structure-activity relationship towards the inhibition of 6-phospho-1-fructokinase, a key enzyme involved in the parasite glycolytic cascade.

The procedure embeds the MD energy profiles on a 2D Cartesian coordinates system using simple heuristic rules. At the same time, we associate the LN with a Markov matrix that describes the probabilities of passing from one state to other in the new 2D space. We construct this type of LNs for 422 MD trajectories obtained in DNA-drug docking experiments of 57 furocoumarins. The combined use of psoralens+ultraviolet light (UVA) radiation is known as PUVA therapy. PUVA is effective in the treatment of skin diseases such as psoriasis and mycosis fungoides. PUVA is also useful to treat human platelet (PTL) concentrates in order to eliminate Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma cruzi. Both are parasites that cause Leishmaniosis (a dangerous skin and visceral disease) and Chagas disease, respectively; and may circulate in blood products collected from infected donors. We included in this study both lineal (psoralens) and angular (angelicins) furocoumarins. In the study, we grouped the LNs on two sets; set1: DNA-drug complex MD trajectories for active compounds and set2: MD trajectories of non-active compounds or no-optimal MD trajectories of active compounds. We calculated the respective pi(k)(L) values for all these LNs and used them as inputs to train a new classifier that discriminate set1 from set2 cases. In training series the model correctly classifies 79 out of 80 (specificity=98.75%) set1 and 226 out of 238 (Sensitivity=94.96%) set2 trajectories.

On the other hand, since compound 22, denitro-analogue of active compound 4, does not show activity, the 5-nitro substituent of indazole ring seems to be essential. Intramolecular cyclization of side chain at position 1 also affords inactive compounds (19, 20). The electrochemical studies showed that the trypanocidal 5-nitroindazole derivatives yielded nitro-anion radical via one-electron process at physiological pH.

Classic clinical manifestations derive from infection of muscle cells leading to progressive cardiomyopathy, while some patients develop megacolon or megaesophagus. A very aggressive clinical course including fulminant meningoencephalitis has been reported in patients who contract Chagas' disease in the background of immunodeficiency. This includes patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection as well as patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy for organ transplant. Currently, only two drugs are approved for the treatment of Chagas' disease, nifurtimox and benznidazole. Both have significant limitations due to common and serious side effects as well as limited availability. A promising group of new drug leads for Chagas' disease is cysteine protease inhibitors targeting cruzain, the major protease of T. cruzi. The inhibitor N-methyl-Pip-F-homoF-vinyl sulfonyl phenyl (N-methyl-Pip-F-hF-VS phi) is in late-stage preclinical development. Therefore, the question arose as to whether protease inhibitors targeting cruzain would have efficacy in Chagas' disease occurring in the background of immunodeficiency. To address this question, we studied the course of infection in recombinase-deficient (Rag1(-/-)) and normal mice infected with T. cruzi. Infections localized to heart and skeletal muscle in untreated normal animals, while untreated Rag1(-/-) mice showed severe infection in all organs and predominantly in liver and spleen. Treatment with the dipeptide N-methyl-Pip-F-hF-VS phi rescued immunodeficient animals from lethal Chagas' infection. The majority (60 to 100%) of inhibitor-treated Rag1(-/-) mice had increased survival, negative PCR, and normal tissues by histopathological examination.";"1";"1";"13";"CHEMBL_2";"2009-11-30"

The mainstay of treatment is chemotherapy, however the drugs of choice, which include benznidazole and miltefosine, are toxic and have numerous side effects. Safe and effective therapies are urgently needed. Marine alpha-pyrones have been previously identified as scaffolds with potential antiprotozoan activities. In this work, using a phenotypic screen, twenty-seven examples of 3-substituted 4-hydroxy-6-methyl alpha-pyrones were synthesized and their antiparasitic efficacy evaluated against Leishmania (L.) infantum and Trypanosoma cruzi in order to evaluate structure-activity relationships within the series. The mechanism of action and the in vivo efficacy of the most selective compound against T. cruzi were evaluated using different techniques. In vitro data indicated that compounds 8, 15, 25, 26 and 28 presented IC50 values in the range between 13 and 54 μM against L. infantum intracellular amastigotes. Among them, hexanoyl substituted pyrone 8 was the most selective and potent, with a Selectivity Index (SI) > 14. Fifteen of the alpha-pyrones were effective against T. cruzi trypomastigotes, with 3-undecanoyl (11) and 3-tetradecanoyl (12) substituted pyrones being the most potent against trypomastigotes, with IC50 values of 1 and 2 μM, respectively, and SI higher than 70. Using flow cytometry and fluorescent-based assays, pyrone 12 was found to induce hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential of T. cruzi, without affecting plasma membrane permeability. An experimental acute phase-murine model, demonstrated that in vivo dosing of 12 (30 mg/kg/day; 5 days), had no efficacy at the first parasitemia onset of T. cruzi, but reduced the second onset by 55% (p < 0.05), suggesting a delayed action in BALB/c mice. Additionally, a histopathology study demonstrated no toxic effects to the treated mice. The finding that several 3-substituted alpha-pyrones have in vitro efficacy against both L. infantum and T. cruzi, and that one analogue exhibited moderate and non-toxic in vivo efficacy against T. cruzi is encouraging, and suggests that this compound class should be explored as long-term treatments in experimental Chagas disease.";"30";"5";"149";"CHEMBL_26";"2020-01-10"

Tipifarnib is an inhibitor of human protein farnesyltransferase. We synthesized tipifarnib analogues that no longer bind to protein farnesyltransferase and display increased potency for killing parasites. This was achieved in a structure-guided fashion by changing the substituents attached to the phenyl group at the 4-position of the quinoline ring of tipifarnib and by replacing the amino group by OMe. Several compounds that kill Trypanosoma cruzi at subnanomolar concentrations and are devoid of protein farnesyltransferase inhibition were discovered. The compounds are shown to be advantageous over other lanosterol 14alpha-demethylase inhibitors in that they show only modest potency for inhibition of human cytochrome P450 (3A4).

However, the antiparasitic activity in Y strain trypomastigotes and host cell cytotoxicity in J774 macrophages revealed that compounds (10 and 18-21) are stronger and more selective antiparasitic agents than thiosemicarbazone (4). Specifically, compounds (18-20), which carry a phenyl at position N3 of heterocyclic ring, were the most active ones, suggesting that this is a structural determinant for activity. In infected macrophages, compounds (18-20) reduced intracellular amastigotes, whereas Benznidazole did not.

Posteriorly, a virtual screening of a library containing 120 small natural and nature-based compounds was performed on both of them.

T. cruzi is susceptible to thiazoles, making this class of compounds appealing for drug development.

Here, we report the structural planning, synthesis and anti-T. cruzi evaluation of new thiazoles derivatives (3a-m and 4a-m), designed from molecular hybridization associated with non-classical bioisosterism. By varying substituents attached to the phenyl and thiazole rings, substituents were observed to retain, enhance or greatly increase their anti-T. cruzi activity, in comparison to the corresponding thiosemicarbazones. In most cases, electron-withdrawing substituents, such as bromine, 3,4-dichloro and nitro groups, greatly increased antiparasitic activity. Specifically, new thiazoles were identified that inhibit the epimastigote proliferation and were toxic for trypomastigotes without affecting macrophages viability. These compounds were also evaluated against cruzain. However, inhibition of this enzyme was not observed, suggesting that the compounds work through another mechanism. In addition, examination of T. cruzi cell death showed that these molecules induce apoptosis. In conclusion, except for compounds 3h and 3k, all thiazoles derivatives evaluated exhibited higher cytotoxic activity against the trypomastigote forms than the reference medicament benznidazole, without affecting macrophages viability.

Moreover, Chagas disease has become widespread due to migrant populations. Additionally, there are no vaccines nor effective treatments to fight the disease because of its long-term nature and complex pathology. Therefore, these facts emphasize how crucial the international effort for the development of new treatments against Chagas disease is. Here, we present the in vitro and in vivo trypanocidal activity of some oxygenated abietane diterpenoids and related compounds. The 1,4-benzoquinone 15, not yet reported, was identified as a fast-acting trypanocidal drug with efficacy against different strains in vitro and higher activity and lower toxicity than benznidazole in both phases of murine Chagas disease. The mode of action was also evaluated, suggesting that quinone 15 kills T. cruzi by inducing mitochondrion-dependent necrosis through a bioenergetics collapse caused by a mitochondrial membrane depolarization and iron-containing superoxide dismutase inhibition. Therefore, the abietane 1,4-benzoquinone 15 can be considered as a new candidate molecule for the development of an appropriate and commercially accessible anti-Chagas drug.";"11";"5";"229";"CHEMBL_30";"2022-02-22"

At the C-terminus, the intramolecular π-π stacking interactions between the aromatic substituents at P1' and P1 restrict the bioactive conformation of the inhibitors, thus minimizing the entropic loss associated with target binding. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that in the absence of an aromatic group at P1, the substituent at P1' interacts with tryptophan-184.

The computational methods of homology modelling and molecular docking predicted some significant differences in the S2 pocket of LmCPB2.8 and cruzain, a related enzyme from Trypanosoma cruzi. Due to the presence of Tyr209 in LmCPB2.8 rather than Glu208 in cruzain sterically demanding, lipophilic ester groups (inhibitor 7d, 9d, 12d and 14d) are predicted to occupy the S2 pocket of the Leishmania protease, but do not form favorable interactions in cruzain, which is in common with our experimental results.

In contrast with other protozoa, the human parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, is auxotrophic for polyamines. Therefore, their intracellular availability depends exclusively on polyamine transport and inhibition of these uptake processes can alter the viability of the parasite. The polyamine analogues used in this work were successfully tested as antiproliferative agents in cancer cells, bacteria, fungi and also showed a potent antiplasmodial effect. We evaluated the activity of these compounds on polyamine transport in T. cruzi and assessed the effects on parasite viability. Three polyamine derivatives, AMXT1501, Ant4 and Ant44, inhibited the putrescine transport in epimastigotes (the insect stage of T. cruzi) with calculated IC50 values of 2.43, 5.02 and 3.98 μM, respectively. In addition, only Ant4 and Ant44 inhibited spermidine transport with IC50 of 8.78 μM and 13.34 μM, respectively. The Ant4 analogue showed a high trypanocidal effect on trypomastigotes (the bloodstream stage of T. cruzi) with an IC50 of 460 nM, (SI = 12.7) while in epimastigotes the IC50 was significantly higher (16.97 μM). In addition, we studied the effect of the combination of benznidazole, a drug used in treating Chagas disease, with Ant4 on the viability of epimastigotes. The combined treatment produced a significant increase on the inhibition of parasites growth compared with individual treatments. In summary, these results suggest that Ant4, a putrescine conjugate, is a promising compound for the treatment of Chagas disease because it showed a potent trypanocidal effect via its inhibition of polyamine import.";"4";"7";"26";"CHEMBL_26";"2020-01-10"

Although these compounds were devoid of activity against T. cruzi cells and TcFPPS, they were efficient growth inhibitors of tachyzoites of T. gondii.

The goal of this work is to investigate the in vitro and in vivo effects of the arylimidamide (AIA) DB766 against T. cruzi. This arylimidamide exhibits strong trypanocidal activity and excellent selectivity for bloodstream trypomastigotes and intracellular amastigotes (Y strain), giving IC(50)s (drug concentrations that reduce 50% of the number of the treated parasites) of 60 and 25 nM, respectively. DB766 also exerts striking effects upon different parasite stocks, including those naturally resistant to benznidazole, and displays higher activity in vitro than the reference drugs. By fluorescent and transmission electron microscopy analyses, we found that this AIA localizes in DNA-enriched compartments and induces considerable damage to the mitochondria. DB766 effectively reduces the parasite load in the blood and cardiac tissue and presents efficacy similar to that of benznidazole in mouse models of T. cruzi infection employing the Y and Colombian strains, using oral and intraperitoneal doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day that were given after the establishment of parasite infection. This AIA ameliorates electrocardiographic alterations, reduces hepatic and heart lesions induced by the infection, and provides 90 to 100% protection against mortality, which is similar to that provided by benznidazole. Our data clearly show the trypanocidal efficacy of DB766, suggesting that this AIA may represent a new lead compound candidate to Chagas' disease treatment.";"3";"3";"127";"CHEMBL_11";"2011-08-01"

Since the type II fatty acid biosynthesis pathway (PfFAS-II) has recently been shown to be indispensable for liver stage malaria parasites, the inhibitory potential of the HDAs against multiple P. falciparum FAS-II (PfFAS-II) elongation enzymes was also evaluated. The highest antiplasmodial activity against blood stages of P. falciparum was displayed by 5-HDA (IC(50) value 6.6 μg/ml), whereas the 2-HDA was the only acid arresting the growth of liver stage P. yoelii infection, in both flow cytometric assay (IC(50) value 2-HDA 15.3 μg/ml, control drug atovaquone 2.5 ng/ml) and immunofluorescence analysis (IC(50) 2-HDA 4.88 μg/ml, control drug atovaquone 0.37 ng/ml). 2-HDA showed the best inhibitory activity against the PfFAS-II enzymes PfFabI and PfFabZ with IC(50) values of 0.38 and 0.58 μg/ml (IC(50) control drugs 14 and 30 ng/ml), respectively. Enzyme kinetics and molecular modeling studies revealed valuable insights into the binding mechanism of 2-HDA on the target enzymes.

This is the first study to indicate therapeutic potential of HDAs against various parasitic protozoa. It also points out that the malarial liver stage growth inhibitory effect of the 2-HDA may be promoted via PfFAS-II enzymes.

We present here the structural design, synthesis, and anti-T. cruzi evaluation of new oxadiazoles denoted 5a-h and 6a-h. The design of these compounds was based on a previous model of computational docking of oxadiazoles on the T. cruzi protease cruzain. We tested the ability of these compounds to inhibit catalytic activity of cruzain, but we found no correlation between the enzyme inhibition and the antiparasitic activity of the compounds. However, we found reliable SAR data when we tested these compounds against the whole parasite. While none of these oxadiazoles showed toxicity for mammalian cells, oxadiazoles 6c (fluorine), 6d (chlorine), and 6e (bromine) reduced epimastigote proliferation and were cidal for trypomastigotes of T. cruzi Y strain. Oxadiazoles 6c and 6d have IC(50) of 9.5 ± 2.8 and 3.5 ± 1.8 μM for trypomastigotes, while Benznidazole, which is the currently used drug for Chagas disease treatment, showed an IC(50) of 11.3 ± 2.8 μM.

Herein, we report the SAR exploration of a novel hit, 2-(4-chlorophenyl)-N-(1-propyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)acetamide previously identified from high throughput screens against T. cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei brucei and Leishmania donovani. An informative set of analogues was synthesized incorporating key modifications of the scaffold resulting in improved potency whilst the majority of compounds retained low cytotoxicity against H9c2 and HEK293 cell lines. The SAR observed against T. cruzi broadly matches that observed against T.b. brucei, suggesting the possibility for a broad-spectrum candidate. This class of compounds therefore warrants further investigation towards development as a treatment for Chagas disease and HAT.";"52";"7";"290";"CHEMBL_30";"2022-02-22"

The current treatments are inadequate and therefore new medical interventions are urgently needed. In this paper we describe the identification of a series of disubstituted piperazines which shows good potency against the target parasite but is hampered by poor metabolic stability. We outline the strategies used to mitigate this issue such as lowering logD, bioisosteric replacements of the metabolically labile piperazine ring and use of plate-based arrays for quick diversity scoping. We discuss the success of these strategies within the context of this series and highlight the challenges faced in phenotypic programs when attempting to improve the pharmacokinetic profile of compounds whilst maintaining potency against the desired target.";"49";"4";"146";"CHEMBL_33";"2023-05-31"
